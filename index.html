<h2 id="official-ruleset">Official Ruleset</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tennis scoring</li>
  <li>Football body parts (ball cannot touch hands or arms)</li>
  <li>Play a bit like volleyball (see below)</li>
  <li>Can be played with any number of people on each side of the net (best is 2 v 2)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="play">Play</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It is up to the players to decide which lines on the court to use. Normally a solo player uses full court singles lines, and teams of two or more use full court doubles lines. However, small teams of new players may prefer to use the service boxes only.</li>
  <li>On each side, you are allowed three touches and three bounces before the ball goes back over the net (however not all of these touches or bounces need to be taken)</li>
  <li>The ball cannot bounce twice in a row</li>
  <li>The ball does not need to bounce between touches - one player can volley the ball to another player</li>
  <li>A player cannot touch the ball to themselves - they must touch it to another player, or over the net (exception: a solo player is allowed to touch it to themselves)</li>
  <li>The ball must be touched over the net (it cannot be touched, then bounce on your own side, then go over the net)</li>
  <li>During one team’s touches, the ball does not need to bounce within the lines of the court - it can go anywhere, including hitting the walls</li>
  <li>Bounces off walls or any surface apart from the floor do not count towards the allowed number of bounces</li>
  <li>The final touch must be taken from behind the net on your own side (i.e. if I take the first touch and the ball goes over the net but it lands ‘out’, one of my team mates is allowed to chase it over to our opponents’ side, touch it back to our side, and then it can be touched over from our side as normal)</li>
  <li>You are allowed to touch the net</li>
  <li>If a point is in dispute, it can be played again</li>
  <li>If three people play 1 v 2, the solo player always serves. Normally the teams swap after each game to allow each person to play solo.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="serving">Serving</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One player serves a full game. Then a player from the opposing team serves the next game. Etc</li>
  <li>Second serves allowed</li>
  <li>Serves can be taken from anywhere behind the service line (no need to switch sides)</li>
  <li>Serves can go anywhere (they don’t need to land within your opponents’ service box)</li>
  <li>Serve counts as a ‘let’ if it hits the net</li>
  <li>Serves can bounce and then be kicked, or can be kicked from the hands without a bounce</li>
</ul>
